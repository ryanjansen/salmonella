# salmonella
Useful toolkit for online education

## Inspiration
As we increasingly shift towards online education, engagement and interaction between teachers and students has undoubtedly declined. Salmonella aims to solve this by providing teachers with a robust range of tools to increase interactivity between students.

## What it does
Functions as a whiteboard/canvas app where teachers can freely drag, drop, move and edit text and mathematical equations. Additionally, free drawing and animations are available.

## How we built it
The main application is on the front-end, built with the Konva-React library. Data is stored locally in the browser through local storage. Animations are made on the server side with ManimGL, and served to the front-end by video.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning two completely new libraries was challenging, requiring us to stay focused throughout the duration of the Hackathon. Furthermore, due to the nature of the application, certain parts were very math heavy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a functional application in such a short period of time.

## What we learned
Several new technologies - HTML canvas, Konva-React and ManimGL. We also further developed our front-end skills and gained valuable experience working on a non-standard web application.

## What's next for Salmonella
Building on the base product by further developing features such as custom animations.
